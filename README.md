# Attack Modifier Basics

### This plugin is basically a cosmetic-only simple implementation of how this could work.

 Attack as Raiden to make fun things happen.
 
 You may get hit by your own attacks.

## Installation

 Get latest AttackModifier.jar release from [releases](https://github.com/NotThorny/AttackModifier/releases) and place it in your `\grasscutter\plugins` folder.
 
 Restart the server if it was already running.
 
 ## Modifying
 
 Avatars and their gadgets are set in AttackModifierCommand.java starting on line 95.
 
 Raiden and Shenhe are both there to show how the cases work, but for adding new avatars just copy a new case with the avatar id you want to add and change the addedAttacks to the gadgets you desire.
